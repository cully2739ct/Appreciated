# Appreciated
I have again been (very frustratingly) trying to perform an automated Twitter Search via AutoIt, and …  I believe that I have narrowed down the authentication issues, mentioned above, to something wrong in/with the hmac function in the aforementioned gen_sig_base function, as the Signature that the gen_sig_base function returns differs from that returned by the OAuth Tool using the same values for $epoch and $nonce.  I have also tried converting the VBA code from https://greglib.org/tweeting-with-vba/ to AutoIt code, but the following statements are not returning the required Objects:  $oAsc = ObjGet("","System.Text.UTF8Encoding") $oEnc = ObjGet("","System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA1")   … so the Base64_HMACSHA1 function from there fails ;( Does anyone know how to fix those ObjGet statements above to successfully return the required Objects?, or better yet …  Does anyone have any working AutoIt code that they are willing and able to share to successfully complete the oAuth Authentication with the Twitter API?  Any and all of your responses and assistance with being able to successfully automate Twitter Searches using AutoIt would be Most Appreciated!  Thank you for all of your help and participation and Have a Great Day!
